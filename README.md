# INST126-Blackjack

This program allows two users to simulate a Blackjack game. Users will control two players: Player 1 and Player 2. Users will play against an automated dealer. Users are allowed to play as many rounds as they would like to. Like real Blackjack, users can also choose to "hit" or "stay" whenever prompted to. The program will automatically count how many times Player 1 and 2 and the dealer have won. Once a user chooses to close the program, the program will output these totals to the terminal. 

To use this program, please run it at the command line. Follow on-screen prompts (what value the user would like Ace to be, whether to "hit" or "stay", whether to continue the game). This program does not accept command line arguments.
